{"description": "Suffixes are groups of letters which are found at the end of a word. Some suffixes change the meaning of a word.  For example: -ation is added to the end of some verbs to form a noun, so 'prepare' becomes 'preparation'; -ly turns some adjectives into adverbs, so 'sad' becomes 'sadly'.  In addition to true suffixes, Spelling Bee includes groups of letters which are found at the end of a number of words.  This is to help you practice spelling groups of words which look similar but are spelled slightly differently."}
