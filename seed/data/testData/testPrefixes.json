{"letters":["im", "ex", "anti", "pos", "dis"]
,"description": "Prefixes are groups of letters added to the beginning of a word, which change its meaning. For example: 'anti' means against, e.g. antisocial; 'inter' means between or among, e.g. international, 'sub' means under, e.g. submarine. In addition to true prefixes, Spelling Bee includes groups of letters which are found at the beginning of a number of words.  This is to help you practice spelling groups of words which look similar but are spelled slightly differently."}
